### Docker 
 
please run following commands to run the app using Docker compose

* docker-compose up -d
* UI could be accessed through http://localhost:8081/ 
* API could be accessed through http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers

For a platform independent, easy and fast running of the project, backend and frontend images where pushed on docker hub and the docker-compose file will pull them directly, 
alternatively Docker files are provided for both backend and frontend, and they could be used to build and run their images locally, but this needs node and maven to be instsalled on the machine.
README files are provided for both frontend and backend for more details.
